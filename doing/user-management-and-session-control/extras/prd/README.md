# User Management and Session Control - Documentation Package

## Overview

This folder contains a complete implementation plan for adding user management and session control features to the Psychic application. The plan transforms the application into a fully-featured subscription service with personalized user experiences.

## Documentation Contents

This documentation package consists of three complementary documents:

1. **[Product Requirements Document (PRD)](user-management-prd.md)** - Comprehensive specifications including:
   - Detailed problem statement and solution overview
   - User stories and acceptance criteria
   - Technical requirements
   - Testing requirements and success criteria

2. **[Technical Implementation Plan](technical-implementation-plan.md)** - Detailed technical approach including:
   - Database solution recommendations (Firebase)
   - Data models and schema design
   - Backend API implementation details
   - Frontend component designs with code examples
   - Integration points with existing features

3. **[Implementation Summary](implementation-summary.md)** - High-level overview including:
   - Key recommendations
   - Phased implementation approach
   - Architecture highlights
   - Success metrics
   - Next steps

## Key Recommendations

1. **Use Firebase** for authentication and database needs to minimize custom code and leverage built-in security features
2. **Follow a phased implementation approach** over 10 weeks:
   - Phase 1: Core Authentication (2 weeks)
   - Phase 2: User Profiles & History (2 weeks)
   - Phase 3: Subscription Management (3 weeks)
   - Phase 4: Administrative Features (2 weeks)
   - Phase 5: Testing & Refinement (1 week)
3. **Integrate seamlessly** with the existing application's UI and features
4. **Implement comprehensive testing** throughout the development process

## Next Steps

1. Review this documentation package
2. Set up the Firebase project and configure the development environment
3. Begin implementation with Phase 1 (Core Authentication)
4. Conduct regular reviews at the end of each phase
5. Implement the testing strategy throughout development

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a comprehensive roadmap for adding user management and session control to the Psychic application. By following this plan, the development team can efficiently implement these features while maintaining the application's performance and user experience.
