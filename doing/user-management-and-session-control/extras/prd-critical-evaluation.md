# Critical Evaluation: User Management and Session Control PRD

## 1. Deconstruction of Core Objectives

- Is there a clear definition of what "success" looks like for this product beyond implementing features? What specific business outcomes are expected?
- How does this feature set directly address the company's broader strategic goals?
- The PRD states this is a "paid subscription service" but lacks specific revenue targets or pricing strategy. What are the revenue expectations?
- What is the timeline for ROI on this development effort? How will we measure if the investment was worthwhile?
- How do we know users actually want personalized psychic experiences? What user research validates this assumption?
- What competitive analysis has been done to ensure these features will be competitive in the market?
- The problem statement lists limitations but doesn't quantify their impact. How much revenue/engagement is currently being lost due to these limitations?

## 2. Challenge of Requirements & Features

### Authentication and Account Management
- Is social login (Google, Facebook) essential for MVP or could it be deferred? What percentage of users are expected to use social login vs. email?
- Email verification adds friction to the signup process. What is the expected drop-off rate? Is this justified?
- The PRD doesn't address account security beyond password strength. What about 2FA, suspicious login detection, or account lockout policies?
- What happens to user data if email verification is never completed? Is there a cleanup process?

### User Profile Management
- What specific profile information is actually needed for the core psychic experience? Is all of this necessary for MVP?
- The PRD mentions a profile picture but doesn't address moderation of these images. What policies will govern appropriate profile images?
- What happens to past readings when a user deletes their account? Are they truly deleted or just hidden?
- What is the data retention policy after account deletion? Does this comply with GDPR, CCPA, and other privacy regulations?

### Session and History Management
- What is the defined "reasonable period of inactivity" for session expiration? This needs to be specific.
- How much reading history will be stored? Is there a limit to how far back users can access?
- Will users be able to delete specific readings from their history? If not, why not?
- How will the system handle very large reading histories for long-term users?

### Subscription Management
- The PRD doesn't define the subscription tiers or pricing. How can we build without this information?
- What happens to a user's data and access when their subscription expires?
- Is there a free tier or trial period? If so, what are the limitations?
- What payment processors will be supported? This has significant implementation implications.
- How will the system handle failed payments, chargebacks, or subscription renewals?
- What regional/currency considerations need to be addressed for international users?

### Administrative Features
- What specific metrics will administrators need to track? The PRD doesn't define reporting requirements.
- What criteria define "inappropriate content" for moderation purposes?
- How will the system handle false positives in automated content filtering?
- What escalation paths exist for content moderation decisions?
- What audit trails are required for administrative actions for compliance purposes?

## 3. Probing of Assumptions

- The PRD assumes Firebase is the best solution without a thorough comparison of alternatives. What specific requirements led to this recommendation?
- There's an assumption that users will want to revisit past readings. What evidence supports this?
- The PRD assumes a web-based implementation. Is there a mobile app planned? If not, why?
- What assumptions are being made about user technical proficiency? Will all users understand concepts like subscription management?
- The PRD assumes users will be comfortable sharing personal information. What privacy concerns might users have about psychic readings being stored?
- What assumptions are being made about the volume of users and scaling requirements?
- The implementation timeline assumes ideal conditions. What contingency plans exist for delays?

## 4. Identification of Risks & Mitigation

- **Technical Risk**: The PRD recommends Firebase but doesn't address potential vendor lock-in. What is the exit strategy if Firebase becomes unsuitable?
- **Security Risk**: Storing sensitive personal information and payment details creates security vulnerabilities. What specific security measures will be implemented beyond the basics mentioned?
- **Compliance Risk**: The PRD doesn't address legal requirements for handling user data (GDPR, CCPA, etc.). What compliance measures are needed?
- **Market Risk**: What if users reject the subscription model? Is there a fallback plan?
- **Resource Risk**: The implementation plan spans 10 weeks. What happens if key team members leave or become unavailable?
- **Integration Risk**: How will the new features integrate with the existing codebase? What technical debt might complicate this?
- **Performance Risk**: How will the additional database queries and authentication checks impact application performance?
- **Content Moderation Risk**: What legal liabilities might arise from user-generated content? How will the company protect itself?

## 5. Scrutiny of UX Considerations

- The PRD lacks user journey maps or flow diagrams. How will users navigate between these new features?
- What happens if a user attempts to access premium features without a subscription? Is there a clear upgrade path?
- How will the UI communicate subscription status and limitations to users?
- The PRD doesn't address error states or recovery paths. What happens when things go wrong?
- How will the authentication flow work on mobile devices vs. desktop?
- What accessibility requirements need to be met? The PRD doesn't mention WCAG compliance or accessibility testing.
- How will the system handle users with slow internet connections or older devices?
- What user feedback mechanisms will be implemented to improve the experience over time?

## 6. Examination of Success Metrics

- The success criteria are primarily feature-based rather than outcome-based. What specific business metrics will determine success?
- What is the target for user adoption of paid subscriptions? What conversion rate is considered successful?
- How will user engagement be measured before and after implementation to demonstrate improvement?
- What is the expected impact on user retention? What retention metrics will be tracked?
- The PRD mentions "90% test coverage" but doesn't define what types of tests this includes. What specific test coverage is required?
- What user satisfaction metrics will be tracked? Will there be a feedback mechanism?
- How will the performance of the authentication system be measured? What are acceptable response times?
- What baseline metrics exist for current user behavior to compare against post-implementation?

## 7. Consideration of Edge Cases & Scalability

- How will the system handle concurrent logins from multiple devices?
- What happens if a user changes their email address? How does this affect authentication?
- How will the system handle subscription upgrades/downgrades in the middle of a billing cycle?
- What happens to scheduled/recurring psychic readings if a user's subscription lapses?
- How will the system scale to handle potential rapid growth in users?
- What database performance optimizations are planned for handling large numbers of users and readings?
- How will the system handle API rate limiting to prevent abuse?
- What disaster recovery plans exist for data loss scenarios?
- How will the system handle maintenance windows or downtime without disrupting user experience?

## 8. Questioning of Prioritization

- Why is the admin dashboard being built in Phase 4 rather than earlier? Wouldn't administrative tools be helpful during the initial rollout?
- Is implementing social login in Phase 1 truly necessary for MVP, or could this be deferred?
- The implementation plan allocates 3 weeks to subscription management but only 2 weeks to core authentication. Is this the right balance?
- Why is content moderation being implemented so late in the process (Phase 4)? This creates risk of inappropriate content during initial launch.
- Testing is allocated only 1 week at the end. Should testing be integrated throughout the development process instead?
- What features could be cut or simplified if the timeline needs to be compressed?
- What is the minimum viable product that could be released earlier to start gathering user feedback?
- Has the team considered a phased rollout to a subset of users before full deployment?

## Summary Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Business Case**: Define clear business objectives, revenue targets, and ROI expectations.
2. **Prioritize MVP Features**: Clearly distinguish between essential and nice-to-have features.
3. **Address Compliance & Security**: Develop comprehensive plans for data protection, privacy compliance, and security.
4. **Enhance User Experience Planning**: Create detailed user journeys and address edge cases.
5. **Define Outcome-Based Metrics**: Shift success criteria from feature completion to business outcomes.
6. **Develop Risk Mitigation Strategies**: Create contingency plans for identified risks.
7. **Reconsider Implementation Sequence**: Evaluate whether the phasing of development aligns with business priorities.
8. **Expand Testing Strategy**: Integrate testing throughout the development process rather than only at the end.
