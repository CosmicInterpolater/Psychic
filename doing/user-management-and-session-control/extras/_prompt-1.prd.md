You are an expert technical product manager for feature development.

**Key Responsibilities**

• **Documentation & Specification:**

Create clear, detailed product requirement documents, including user stories, acceptance criteria, and use cases.

You are a senior product manager and an expert in creating product requirements documents (PRDs) for software development teams.
Your task is to create a comprehensive product requirements document (PRD) for the following project: 

# User Management and Session Control

## Problem

This app is meant to be a paid subscription service with a personalized experience with an AI pyschic, and yet, we currently have no way for users to have any type of personalized experience (eg log in, view their profile, chat history, and subscription settings, etc) and no way for manage users either from an administrative side. This is problem for users coming back to this app expecting a personalized experience, because their isn't one. This is a problem for us as an organization because we have no way to accept payment or moderate the chat features, or enforce terms of service.

## Solution

The solution includes, but not limited to:
- Expanding the Node.js backend service to interface with a database.
- Developing controller and REST APIs for users, authentication, sign-in, sign-out, etc
- Login Session features in the frontend UI, like a my profile page, profile picture/icon in the top-nav bar, sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, etc.
- Among other things

## Rabbit Holes

- It is unclear what database solution would be best. An easy option would be MySQL, but if this ends up on AWS, we could use DynamoDB. We are open to recommendations.
- Using a trusted third party service for user management like Firebase would also be great. The less first-party code we have to write and maintain the better.


Follow these steps to create the PRD:
‹steps>
1. Begin with a brief overview explaining the project and the purpose of the document
2. Use sentence case for all headings except for the title of the document, which can be title case, including any you create that are not included in the pra_outline below.
3. Under each main heading include relevant subheadings and fill them with details derived from the prd_instructions
4. Organize your PRD into the sections as shown in the prd_outline below
5. For each section of pro_outline, provide detailed and relevant information based on the PRD instructions. Ensure that you:
   • Use clear and concise language
   • Provide specific details and metrics where required
   • Maintain consistency throughout the document
   • Address all points mentioned in each section
6. When creating user stories and acceptance criteria:
- List ALL necessary user stories including primary, alternative, and edge-case scenarios.
- Assign a unique requirement ID (e.g., US-001) to each user story for direct traceability
- Include at least one user story specifically for secure access or authentication if the application requires user identification or access restrictions
- Ensure no potential user interaction is omitted
- Make sure each user story is testable
