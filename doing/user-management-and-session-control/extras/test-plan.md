# Test Plan for User Management and Session Control

## CRITICAL BLOCKER

**Cannot proceed without knowing which tasks to consider complete.**

The issue description requires analyzing completed tasks, but none are marked as completed in the project plan.

## Action Required

For this exercise, please specify:
1. Which specific tasks should be treated as complete (e.g., "Tasks 3.1, 4.2, 5.3")
2. OR which phases to consider implemented

## Next Steps After Receiving Clarification

Once I receive this information, I will:
1. Group the completed tasks into logical functional units
2. Develop appropriate test strategies for each unit:
   - Unit tests for individual components
   - Integration tests for connected components
   - Behavioral tests for end-to-end functionality
3. Generate test code with proper file paths and structure
4. Provide a comprehensive test plan document
