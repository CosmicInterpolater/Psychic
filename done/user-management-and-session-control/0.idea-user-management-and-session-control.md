# User Management and Session Control

## Problem

This app is meant to be a paid subscription service with a personalized experience with an AI psychic, and yet, we currently have no way for users to have any type of personalized experience (eg log in, view their profile, chat history, and subscription settings, etc) and no way for manage users either from an administrative side. This is problem for users coming back to this app expecting a personalized experience, because there isn't one. This is a problem for us as an organization because we have no way to accept payment or moderate the chat features, or enforce terms of service. 

## Solution

The solution includes, but not limited to:
- Expanding the Node.js backend service to interface with a database. 
- Developing controller and REST APIs for users, authentication, sign-in, sign-out, etc
- Login Session features in the frontend UI, like a 'my profile page', profile picture/icon in the top-nav bar, sign-up, sign-in, sign-out, etc.
- Among other things

## Rabbit Holes

- It is unclear what database solution would be best. An easy option would be MySQL, but if this ends up on AWS, we could use DynamoDB. We are open to recommendations.
- Using a trusted third party service for user management like Firebase would also be great. The less first-party code we have to write and maintain the better.
