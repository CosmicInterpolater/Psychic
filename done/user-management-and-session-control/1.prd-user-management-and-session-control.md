# User Management and Session Control

## Document overview

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) outlines the implementation of user management and session control features for the Psychic application. The document provides comprehensive specifications for adding user authentication, profile management, and session handling to transform the application into a personalized subscription service.

## Problem statement

The Psychic application is designed to be a paid subscription service offering personalized AI psychic experiences. However, the current implementation lacks:

- User authentication and account management
- Personalized user experiences (profiles, chat history, preferences)
- Administrative controls for user management
- Payment processing capabilities
- Content moderation tools
- Terms of service enforcement

These limitations prevent users from having a consistent, personalized experience across sessions and hinder the organization's ability to monetize the service, moderate content, and enforce terms of service.

## Solution overview

The solution will implement a comprehensive user management system with the following key components:

1. User authentication and account management
2. User profile and personalization features
3. Session management and persistence
4. Administrative controls and moderation tools
5. Integration with the existing psychic reading features

### Technical approach

The implementation will:

1. Expand the Node.js backend to interface with a database (Firebase Firestore recommended)
2. Develop REST APIs for user management (authentication, profile management, etc.)
3. Implement frontend UI components for user sessions (login, signup, profile management)
4. Integrate with the existing application features to provide personalized experiences
